Navigate to the URL given through Sinatra on a web browser.

## Usage
Application includes a login/logout for both a student and a teacher, a view index page with all appointments, the ability to create a new appointment, edit appointments, update appointments, and delete appointments. There is also the ability to view a single appointment, or all appointments belonging to a student, or all appointments belonging to a teacher.
